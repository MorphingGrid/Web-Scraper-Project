# Web Scraper Project
 
Personal Project. I designed a Web Scraper using a combination of BeautifulSoup4 and Selenium to scrape popular job boards such as LinkedIn and Indeed as well as Handshake.

This was done using Anaconda instead of pip so the requirements.txt is very bloated. You need Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Re, and ChromeWebDriver for this. 

There are two programs, one for LinkedIn and one for Indeed. The handshake implementation was omitted due to privacy converns and a seperate solution for dynamic HTML Updates. requires the latest version of Google Chrome and the Chrome WebDriver

A visualization of my results can be found on Tableau Public:
