# Web Scraper Project
 
Personal Project. I designed a Web Scraper using a combination of BeautifulSoup4 and Selenium to scrape popular job boards such as LinkedIn and Indeed.

This was done using Anaconda instead of pip so the requirements.txt is very bloated. You need Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Re, and ChromeWebDriver for this. 

There are two programs, one for LinkedIn and one for Handshake, requires the latest version of Google Chrome and the Chrome WebDriver
